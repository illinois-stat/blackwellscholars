[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).

The **David H. Blackwell Summer Scholars Program** is designed to increase the access and equity in the pipeline for graduate degrees in statistics, data science, and mathematics. The **David H.

This website was built using `r R.version.string` and the following packages:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```
